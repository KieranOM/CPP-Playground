## OpenGL1 (JoystickInput)
In this project, I've experimented with OpenGL and the idea of abstracting input (for games) away from a hardware level, instead emulating joystick-like input with the keyboard. I've used OpenGL to show a visualisation of the input on screen.

The idea behind this way to play with the idea of creating a universal input system for games, creating a template class to provide the values and methods used, then an implementation class for each OS.
